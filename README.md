# freeCodeCamp Flutter Essentials
## Flutter
Flutter is a UI software development kit from Google that allows developers to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

### freeCodeCamp Flutter Essentials
freeCodeCamp released a [Flutter Essentials course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2IGQT3BZQo) on the freeCodeCamp.org [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp). This beginner's course will teach you everything you need to know to get started building apps with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). The course was created by MTechViral.

Flutter uses the [Dart programming language,](https://dart.dev/) but prior Dart experience is not required to watch this course. It would be helpful to have expereince with at least one other programming language, though.
